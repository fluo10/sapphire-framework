/// Truncating in place would destroy the ledger if we crashed mid-write. A
/// device id is baked into journal frontmatter, so losing the ledger leaves past
/// references unresolvable — hence the same trick `KeyStore::save_entries` uses.
///
/// Unlike `keys.rs`, the file is not created 0600: this ledger holds no secrets
/// (tokens live in the key file) and the whole workspace is meant to sync, so
/// an owner-only permission would be pointless.
///
/// The temp file name carries the process id and a per-process counter. Two
/// processes writing the same ledger at once (or two threads in one process)
/// would each `File::create` (truncate) a fixed `*.tmp` name, interleaving both
/// writes into one inode and publishing a half-written file on the first
/// rename. This only narrows that window, never closes it — there is no lock,
/// so whoever renames last wins.
