//! The device ledger for a sapphire workgroup.
//!
//! One TOML file per device, named by the device's grain-id. One file per record is what
//! lets two hosts pair at the same moment without colliding: each writes its own file, and
//! the sync layer sees two independent additions rather than one contested file.
//!
//! Path conventions belong to the caller. This crate takes a directory and works inside it.
