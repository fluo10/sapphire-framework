## [0.12.0](https://github.com/fluo10/sapphire-workspace/compare/v0.11.0...v0.12.0) - 2026-05-23

### Changed

- `sapphire-sync`: bump `git2` from 0.20 to 0.21. This pulls in a new major of `libgit2-sys` (a `-sys` crate with a `links` key), released as a minor bump to avoid silent build failures for downstream crates that depend on a different `libgit2-sys` major. See `RELEASING.md` for the `-sys` policy.

### Internal

- Adopt release-plz for automated version bumps, CHANGELOG generation, and crates.io publishing.
- Add `.DS_Store` to `.gitignore`.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-16

### Changed (breaking)

- `sapphire-retrieve`: `JsonChunker` is renamed to `JsonlChunker` and reduced to per-line JSON parsing with a raw-text fallback for partial writes. The previous array / nested-messages support was unused outside the JSONL path. (#53)
- `sapphire-workspace`: plain `.json` files are no longer indexed. The bulk indexer and `on_file_updated` now skip them; only `.jsonl` is processed through the JSONL chunker. (#53)
- `sapphire-workspace`: existing retrieve indexes built on a previous version will have stale chunk boundaries for `.jsonl` files. A re-index is recommended after upgrading so that subsequent appends are picked up incrementally rather than re-embedding the file.

### Performance

- `sapphire-workspace`: `on_file_updated` pre-chunks `.jsonl` files line-by-line instead of falling back to the storage-layer paragraph chunker. Previously every append shifted chunk boundaries and re-embedded most of the file; now existing lines retain their `(doc_id, line_start)` identity and only the appended lines are embedded. (#53)

### Changed

- `sapphire-retrieve`: bump `lancedb` from 0.27 to 0.29 and `arrow-array` / `arrow-schema` from 57 to 58 in lockstep. (#55)
- `sapphire-workspace`: bump `md-5` from 0.10 to 0.11. (#52)

## [0.10.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- `sapphire-workspace`: `WorkspaceState::write_file` could not create new files — `canonicalize_or_parent` returned paths with a trailing separator (e.g. `/workspace/memory/daily/2026-04-19.md/`) for not-yet-existing files, and `std::fs::write` failed with `EISDIR`. `Path::join` with an empty path appends a separator; the walk-up loop now seeds its suffix with `PathBuf::from(name)` on the first iteration. Existing files were unaffected because the `canonicalize()` fast-path skipped the buggy branch. (#48)

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-20

### Changed (breaking)

- `sapphire-sync`: `SyncConfig` collapsed back into a single flat struct (`backend`, `remote`, `branch`); `WorkspaceSyncConfig` and `UserSyncConfig` are gone. The workspace/user split no longer carries meaningful distinction once `device_id` moves out of config. (#45)
- `sapphire-sync`: `sync_interval_minutes` dropped from `SyncConfig`; periodic cadence is the host app's concern (the CLI exposes it as `UserConfig::sync_interval_minutes`).
- `sapphire-retrieve`: `RetrieveConfig::sync_interval_minutes` and `sync_interval()` removed.
- `sapphire-workspace`: `WorkspaceState::sync_git` / `sync_retrieve` / `periodic_sync` helpers removed. `watch` in the CLI collapses its two independent timers into a single `periodic_sync()` tick backed by `sync()`.
- `sapphire-workspace`: `WorkspaceState::open_configured` no longer takes a device id / defaults pair — it reads them from the workspace's `AppContext`.
- `sapphire-workspace`: `device_id` is no longer stored in `config.toml`. `AppContext::device_id()` is now a get-or-create accessor backed by `<data_dir>/device_id`; first call generates a UUIDv7 and persists it.
- `sapphire-workspace`: `AppContext` gains `data_dir` / `set_data_dir`, and the library's `dirs` dependency is dropped. Host apps are expected to resolve and inject both `cache_dir` and `data_dir` at startup so the library stays portable to mobile sandboxes.
- `sapphire-sync`: git auto-sync commits now use an RFC 822 / `git interpret-trailers` compatible `Device-Id:` trailer (message becomes `auto: sync by [<uuid>]\n\nDevice-Id: <uuid>`). `GitSync` exposes only `with_device_id(Uuid)`; commit formatting is fully encapsulated.

### Added

- `sapphire-sync`: `DeviceRegistry` backed by a JSONL file (`{marker}/devices.jsonl`) recording each device's hostname, app id/version, platform, arch, and `registered_at` / `updated_at` timestamps. Enables reverse lookup from commit UUIDs and a stable 1-based Device Number derived from UUIDv7 order. (#46)
- `sapphire-workspace`: `DeviceContext` (process-wide device state) on `AppContext` via `set_device_defaults`, `device()`, and `update_device_name_if_newer`. Host-detected fields (hostname, app_id, app_version, platform, arch) are always refreshed from the running binary on open; only user-editable fields (`name`, `updated_at`) follow the "newer `updated_at` wins" rule, so an app-version bump no longer touches `updated_at`.
- `sapphire-workspace-cli`: `device {list, set-name, show}` subcommands exposing the registry; renames are staged via the git backend so the next `sync` propagates them.
- `sapphire-workspace-cli`: top-level `tracing_subscriber` initialised once in `main()`; device-id persistence failures now surface via `tracing::error!` instead of ad-hoc `eprintln!`.

### Renamed

- `sapphire-sync`: `client` / `client_version` renamed to `app_id` / `app_version` across the device registry — this is a local-first app, not client-server, and the new names match `env!("CARGO_PKG_NAME")` / `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed (breaking)

- `sapphire-retrieve`: full-text search now indexes **chunks** (via `chunks_fts`) instead of whole documents. `search_fts`, `search_similar`, and `search_hybrid` all return `Vec<FileSearchResult>` — each file carries a `chunks` array with the matched line ranges (`line_start`, `line_end`), so MCP / AI callers can see *where* inside a file a match occurred without re-reading the whole document.
- `sapphire-retrieve`: `SearchResult` / `ChunkSearchResult` / `dedup_chunk_results` / `merge_rrf` removed; replaced by `FileSearchResult` / `ChunkHit` / `merge_rrf_files`.
- `sapphire-retrieve`: Query structs introduced (`FtsQuery`, `VectorQuery`, `HybridQuery`) with builder methods. All three take `query: &str` as a common field; `VectorQuery` / `HybridQuery` also accept an `Embedder` (mandatory for vector, optional for hybrid — `None` falls back to FTS-only). Callers no longer pre-compute embeddings.
- `sapphire-retrieve`: `RetrieveStore::search_hybrid` added to the trait with a default implementation, and exposed on `RetrieveDb`.
- `sapphire-retrieve`: `search_fts` / `search_similar` / `search_hybrid` accept an optional `path_prefix` that is pushed down to the backend (SQLite `GLOB`, LanceDB `only_if`), replacing the post-filter that previously lived in `WorkspaceState`.
- `sapphire-retrieve`: chunk schema changed from `(line, column)` to `(line_start, line_end)` — inclusive line range. `TextChunk`, `Chunk`, and all backend schemas updated.
- `sapphire-retrieve`: `documents.body` column / field dropped from storage (still used as chunker input when `Document::chunks` is `None`). SQLite `documents_fts` virtual table removed; LanceDB FTS now indexes `chunks_meta.text`.
- `sapphire-retrieve`: **schema migration required.** SQLite databases on version `<4` are automatically wiped and recreated on first open (next sync re-indexes the workspace). LanceDB is bumped to `lancedb_v4/`; the old `lancedb_v3/` directory is no longer used and can be removed manually.
- `sapphire-retrieve`: `title` field removed from `Document` and `FileSearchResult`; `doc_title` dropped from `Chunk` and all backend schemas. Embedding text no longer prepends the title. Display names should be resolved by the application layer from `path`. (#43)

### Added

- `sapphire-workspace`: file operation methods (`read_file`, `read_file_range`, `write_file`, `append_file`, `delete_file`) now validate that paths resolve within the workspace root, preventing path traversal attacks. A new `allow_external_paths` flag on `AppContext` lets applications opt in to external file access — external files use plain `std::fs` without index or sync updates. (#42)

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- `sapphire-sync`: SSH credentials callback no longer loops infinitely when `ssh-agent` returns a credential that fails authentication. The callback now tracks attempt index and cycles through methods (ssh-agent → key files) instead of retrying the same method. (#38)
- `sapphire-sync`: remote push rejections are now logged via `tracing::warn` (previously silently ignored due to missing `push_update_reference` callback).

### Added

- `sapphire-sync`: `tracing` instrumentation in `sync_git` for observability (fetch/merge/push cycle start, early-return, push result).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-12

### Changed

- `sapphire-sync`: `SyncConfig` split into three types — `WorkspaceSyncConfig` (workspace-level: `backend`, `remote`, `branch`, `sync_interval_minutes`), `UserSyncConfig` (device-level: `device_id`), and `SyncConfig` (flattened combination; TOML `[sync]` section layout unchanged).
- `sapphire-retrieve`: `RetrieveConfig` gains `sync_interval_minutes: Option<u32>` and a `sync_interval()` helper, enabling independent scheduling of the retrieve cache refresh from git sync.
- `sapphire-workspace`: `WorkspaceState::open_configured` now takes `&SyncConfig` instead of `&WorkspaceConfig`.  `load_retrieve_backend`, `load_embedder`, `sync_and_embed`, and `embed_pending` now take `&RetrieveConfig` directly.
- `sapphire-workspace`: added `sync_git(&SyncConfig)` and `sync_retrieve(&RetrieveConfig)` as independent public methods; `periodic_sync()` is now a convenience wrapper over the two.
- `sapphire-workspace`: `src/config.rs` is now re-exports only (`sapphire_retrieve::config` and `sapphire_sync::config`); all config struct definitions live in their home crates.
- `sapphire-workspace-cli`: `UserConfig` (with `load`, `save`, and env-var overrides) moved into the CLI crate.  Layered config loading (`load_layered`) removed — a single user config file is used.
- `sapphire-workspace-cli`: `watch` command now runs two independent timers: one for git sync (`config.sync.sync_interval()`) and one for retrieve cache refresh (`config.retrieve.sync_interval()`).

### Removed

- `WorkspaceConfig` and `UserConfig` removed from the public API of `sapphire-workspace`.
- `.sapphire-workspace/config.toml` is no longer read for sync or retrieve settings (the marker directory is still used for workspace root discovery).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- `sapphire-sync`: SSH push and fetch now authenticate correctly via libgit2.  Previously `remote.push()` / `remote.fetch()` were called without `RemoteCallbacks`, causing push to silently fail against SSH remotes.  Authentication is now attempted in order: ssh-agent → `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` → `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa` → `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. (#30)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-11

### Changed

- `WorkspaceState::retrieve_db()` now returns `Arc<dyn RetrieveStore>` instead of the concrete `RetrieveDb` type.  Callers that previously called methods on `RetrieveDb` directly should switch to the `RetrieveStore` trait interface.
- `sapphire-retrieve`: added backend factory functions `open_sqlite_fts`, `open_sqlite_vec`, `open_lancedb`, `open_in_memory` — each returns `Arc<dyn RetrieveStore + Send + Sync>` (feature-gated as before).
- `sapphire-retrieve`: `RetrieveDb::dedup_chunk_results` moved to a crate-level free function `dedup_chunk_results`; the method on `RetrieveDb` is kept as a deprecated shim.
- `sapphire-retrieve`: `wipe_db_files` is now `pub` (was `pub(crate)`).
- `sqlite-store` feature is now enabled by default (previously opt-in); the default feature set now includes `sqlite-store`, `lancedb-store`, `fastembed-embed`, and `git-sync`.

### Deprecated

- `RetrieveDb` — use `Arc<dyn RetrieveStore>` returned by `WorkspaceState::retrieve_db()` instead.  `RetrieveDb` re-export is kept for one release to ease migration.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- `WorkspaceState::retrieve_files` — unified search method supporting full-text, semantic, and hybrid (FTS + semantic via Reciprocal Rank Fusion) modes with configurable weights; accepts an optional folder path filter for scoping results.
- `WorkspaceState::sync_workspace_incremental` — mtime-based incremental indexer that only re-indexes files changed since the last sync, making periodic background refreshes much cheaper than a full rescan.
- `WorkspaceState::periodic_sync` — orchestrates a full sync cycle: git sync (if configured) followed by an incremental cache refresh.
- `SyncConfig::device_id: Option<Uuid>` and `SyncConfig::ensure_device_id()` — per-device UUID embedded in git commit messages for tracing sync origin across devices.
- CLI: layered config loading via the `config` crate — workspace-level `{marker}/config.toml` (shared across devices) merged with a per-user override file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sapphire-workspace/config.toml`).
- CLI: per-device UUID managed in the user-level config; git commits carry the message `auto: sync [<uuid>]`.

### Changed

- `sync_interval_minutes` moved from `SyncConfig` (`sapphire-sync`) to `WorkspaceConfig` (`sapphire-workspace`); periodic sync is now orchestrated by `WorkspaceState` to cover both git sync and cache refresh.

### Removed

- `sapphire_workspace::util::merge_toml_values` — use the `config` crate directly for layered config merging.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-08

Internal repository restructure; no public API changes.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- `AppContext` struct — cross-platform cache directory helper; carries `app_name` and computes `cache_dir()` / `model_cache_dir()` on all platforms (XDG on Linux, Platform-specific on macOS/Windows).
- `Workspace::from_root_with_uuid` / `Workspace::find_from_with_uuid` — open or discover a workspace when the UUID is already known (avoids recomputing from the path).
- `Workspace.uuid` stored as a field on construction (previously recomputed on every call to `uuid()`).
- `SyncConfig.sync_interval_minutes: Option<u32>` (in `sapphire-sync`) — configures automatic periodic sync; `sync_interval()` helper returns the value as `std::time::Duration`.

### Changed

- `Workspace::open_with_ctx` / `Workspace::find_with_ctx` and related methods now accept an `AppContext` as the first argument (was a separate `app_name: &'static str` parameter).
- `WorkspaceState` construction methods require an explicit `AppContext`; there is no longer a default (implicit) context.
- `Workspace.ctx` is now a public field so downstream crates can read `app_name` and `cache_dir` directly.
- `SyncConfig` and `SyncBackendKind` moved to `sapphire_sync::config` (public module); `sapphire-workspace` re-exports them via `pub use`.
- `RetrieveConfig`, `VectorDb`, and `EmbeddingConfig` moved to `sapphire_retrieve::config` (public module); `sapphire-workspace` re-exports them via `pub use`.
- `VectorDb` is now a top-level field of `RetrieveConfig` (`retrieve.db` in TOML) instead of nested inside `EmbeddingConfig`.
- `AppContext.cache_dir()` renamed from `cache_base()`; `app_name` is now folded into the cache path automatically.
- `EmbedderConfig.cache_dir: Option<PathBuf>` added to `sapphire-retrieve`; callers inject the model cache directory via `AppContext.model_cache_dir()` instead of relying on `dirs`.

### Removed

- `AppContext::set_model_cache_dir()` — replaced by `set_cache_dir()` which covers the same use-case.
- Implicit default `AppContext` on `WorkspaceState`; callers must supply one explicitly.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- `WorkspaceState::read_file(relative)` — read a workspace-relative text file and return its contents as a `String`.
- `WorkspaceState::read_file_range(relative, start_line, end_line)` — read a line range from a workspace-relative text file (1-indexed, inclusive; `end_line: None` reads to EOF; out-of-bounds lines are silently clamped).
- `WorkspaceState::list_dir(relative)` — list the direct children of a workspace-relative directory, returning `(workspace-relative path, is_dir)` pairs sorted alphabetically.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- `Workspace::find_with_app_name` / `Workspace::find_from_with_app_name` — discover a workspace using a custom app name so that host applications (e.g. `sapphire-journal`) can keep their marker directories and XDG caches in their own namespace.
- `Workspace::from_root_with_app_name` — open a workspace at a known path with a custom app name.
- `path_uuid` free function — compute the stable UUIDv8 workspace identifier without constructing a `Workspace`.  Useful for host crates that share the same cache namespace.

### Changed

- Workspace UUID algorithm switched from UUIDv3 (SHA-1 + external namespace) to **UUIDv8** derived from the MD5 hash of the canonicalised path.  The UUID is now self-contained and does not depend on any compile-time namespace constant.  Existing cached data (SQLite DB, LanceDB directory) must be regenerated after upgrading.
- `Workspace::app_name` is now a `&'static str` instead of a `String`; construction via the `_with_app_name` variants requires a `'static` string literal.
- `Workspace::cache_dir()` now incorporates `app_name` in the XDG path: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/{app_name}/{uuid}/`.
- Bumped `sapphire-retrieve` and `sapphire-sync` dependencies to `0.3.0`.

### Removed

- Internal `marker` field on `Workspace` replaced by `app_name`; marker directory name is always computed as `".{app_name}"` on the fly.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- Initial public release of `sapphire-workspace`.
- `Workspace` struct with marker-based discovery (`find`, `find_from`, `from_root`).
- `WorkspaceState` — lazily initialises the retrieve DB, embedder, and sync backend.
- `WorkspaceConfig` stored in `{marker}/config.toml` (TOML).
- `UserConfig` legacy fallback loaded from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sapphire-workspace-cli/config.toml`.
- Sync backend selection: `auto` (default), `git`, `none`.
- File-level index helpers: `write_file`, `append_file`, `delete_file`, `on_file_updated`, `on_file_deleted`.
- Bulk indexer (`sync_workspace`) supporting Markdown, plain text, JSON, and JSONL files.
- JSON/JSONL chunking via `sapphire-retrieve`'s `JsonChunker`; source line positions preserved in `ChunkSearchResult`.
- `fastembed-embed`, `lancedb-store`, `sqlite-store`, `git-sync` feature flags.
- Re-exports of `sapphire-retrieve` and `sapphire-sync` public APIs.
